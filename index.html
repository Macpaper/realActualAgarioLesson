<!-- Javascript Lesson - Javascript is a prototype based, dynamically typed,
single-threaded programming language. It is used in virtually every single
website that people use. It can be used in tandem with HTML and CSS to create
websites, games, applications, mobile-apps, desktop apps, and more. It is the
most popular programming language today. These lessons will be exploring the
Javascript syntax, how it connects to HTML and CSS, similarities between other
languages, and creating games and webapps that can be published freely online.
Today we started learning Javascript! I started by having Preston download the
industry standard Javascript IDE and creating an HTML file. We learned the
difference between statically typed and dynamic languages, the similarities
between Java and Javascript (despite the name, the two are not the same. Java is
to Javascript what Ham is to Hamster), and how to start programming it. We then
did a quick GUI project involving moving circles on a screen that bounce when
they reach the edges using collision code (logic we've seen before). very good!
he learn very fast. now do keyboard stuff? now do a game or something? agario in
javascript? hmm?? -->
